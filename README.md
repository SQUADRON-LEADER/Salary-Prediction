## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **predicting salaries** using machine learning models trained on historical data. We aim to understand how features such as experience, education level, location, job role, company size, and skillset influence salary levels in various industries.

### 🔍 Why Salary Prediction?

Salary prediction models can be game-changing in real-world scenarios:

* 🎯 **For Job Seekers:** Estimate fair compensation based on qualifications.
* 🧑‍💼 **For Recruiters/HRs:** Set competitive and transparent pay structures.
* 💡 **For Analysts:** Gain insights into market trends, skill demands, and salary disparities.

By leveraging machine learning, this project attempts to automate this estimation using multiple regression algorithms.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Preprocess raw salary data for model consumption
* Visualize correlations and trends in salary features
* Build regression models (Linear, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
* Evaluate performance using R², MAE, and RMSE metrics
* Save and deploy models for real-time prediction

---

## 🧠 Key Features & Functionality

* 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, categorical encoding
* 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Visuals that reveal feature impact on salary
* 🧠 **Model Training & Testing** – Multiple regression models compared
* 📈 **Performance Metrics** – Detailed scoring and benchmarking
* 💾 **Model Export** – Finalized model saved using `pickle`
* 🧪 **Interactive Notebook** – Easy-to-understand workflow in Jupyter
